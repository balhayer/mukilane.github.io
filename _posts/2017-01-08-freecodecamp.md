## About FreeCodeCamp

Free Code Camp is an opensource community that helps people learn to code and help non-profits. It features self-paced Full Stack JavaScript curriculum. Found by Quincy Larson, it is now the most popular project in Github. 

## Certifications

There are four certifications namely:

1. Front End Certification
2. Data Visualization Certification
3. Back End Certification
4. Full Stack Certification

## My status

Currently, I have completed the [Front End Certification][https://www.freecodecamp.com/mukilane/front-end-certification] for which I had to complete several small programs and algorithms, 4 mini projects and 5 small projects. 

## Mini Projects
These are pretty basic projects involving mostly using `XmlHttpRequest` ( more broadly know as `AJAX` ) for getting data from third party API's of Twtich & Wikipedia. The personal portfolio page is `this` site itself, which I later revamped into a more professional site.

1. [Twitch Status Viewer](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/twitchstatus")
2. [Wiki Viewer](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/wikiviewer)
3. [Quote Machine](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/quoter)
4. [Personal Portfolio page](https://mukilane.github.io/about_the_site)


## Small Projects
These are still basic projects, but required some algorithms and control flow. All of them were inspired by Material Design, of which the Calculator is an almost exact replication of Google's Calculator. 

1. [Pomodoro Clock](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/pomodoro)
2. [Weather App](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/weather)
3. [Simon Game](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/simongame)
4. [Tic Tac Toe](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/tictactoe)
5. [Calculator](https://mukilane.github.io/projects/calculator)
