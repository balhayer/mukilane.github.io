The 100 Days Of Code Challenge was created by Alexander Kallaway. It is a self imposed challenge to build our habit of coding everyday. Making a public commitment motivates me to stick to the challenge and develop the habit of coding. For the first few days, I had to force myself ( to some extent ) to follow the challenge. But as days pass, the process becomes natural.

You can join me in this challenge here: [100DaysOfCode][100-days-of-code]

You can track my progress on this [Github repo][github] or on [Twitter][twitter].

All the code are available in my Github, cause I embrace Opensource.
