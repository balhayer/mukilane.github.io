<b>Google Developer Days (GDD)</b> is a series of developer events around the world showcasing various products of Google. They provide a platform for developer engagement as well as provide an opportunity to meet the teams behind the products.

GDD events have taken place over many countries, starting all the way from 2007. And the GDD India 2017 is the first biggest Google developer event to take place in India. And the host city is nothing but India's Silicon Valley, the Bangalore city. The huge developer base of India has captured the attention of the tech giant and it is a no-brainer to conduct an event here. 

GDD India took place between December 1 and 2, at the Bengaluru International Exhibition Centre. Google offered travel and accomodation discounts, and provided shuttles for the city. 

Spanning the 2 days are various sessions, from speeches, codelabs, office hours, community talks and an after hour party.
