<b>Google Developer Days (GDD)</b> is a series of developer events around the world showcasing various products of Google. They provide a platform for developer engagement as well as provide an opportunity to meet the teams behind the products.

GDD events have taken place over many countries, starting all the way from 2007. And the GDD India 2017 is the first biggest Google developer event to take place in India. And the host city is nothing but India's Silicon Valley, the Bangalore city. The huge developer base of India has captured the attention of the tech giant and it is a no-brainer to conduct an event here. 

GDD India took place between December 1 and 2, at the Bengaluru International Exhibition Centre. Google offered travel and accomodation discounts, and provided shuttles for the city. 

Spanning the 2 days are various sessions, from speeches, 

The 100 Days Of Code Challenge is a self imposed challenge to build our habit of coding everyday. It was created by a developer, Alexander Kallaway. It relies on the concept of [purposeful practice][practice], where mastery can be acheived through constant delibrate practice.

>> “If we follow the mastery process long enough, inspired by a profound interest and curiosity we cannot fail to achieve something exceptional.” — Robert Greene

With any challenge comes our procastination. In order to mitigate that, the challenge requires us to make a public commitment, like on Twitter using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode. The commitment would be even more effective if we make it to our friends circle.

The first few days are important. Once the pace picks up, we get stuck with it subconsiously. At the same time, overcommitment would also prove inefficient. There has to be a balance.

One of the important rules of this challenge is to encourage others to join it. This way, there is a healthy environment where each other can be a motivation.

You can read about the challenge from the creator on his [medium post][medium-post]. You can join me in this challenge here: [100DaysOfCode][100-days-of-code]

Another useful thing about the challenge is that you are going to keep a journal of our progress. It is a valuable tool to gauge our performance, analyse and improve it.
